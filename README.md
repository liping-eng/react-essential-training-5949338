## Course Description

In this course, software developer and instructor Eve Porcello highlights the latest techniques for building a React app from scratch. Learn how to create elements, write components, and use React hooks. Get familiar with libraries like Next and Vite, and discover the differences between React Server Components and Client Components. Find out how to use the latest tools, techniques, and patterns that will help futureproof applications and make them more scalable and performant. After watching the course, you will be able to start your own project from scratch, and you will also be able to jump into an existing React codebase and make an impact.

_See the readme file in the main branch for updated instructions and information._
## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
